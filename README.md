# BlackJack_App
Program made as part of the final assignment at NSCC for PROG2700 - Clientside programming.

This is a simple app made in vanilla Javascript that uses the public api https://deckofcardsapi.com/ to simulate a game of blackjack!

Program uses a simple library https://github.com/sbrl/soundbox to play sounds, and used Gulp to run SASS to manage the CSS styling. Learn how to install GULP here https://css-tricks.com/gulp-for-beginners/
